Analysis tasks
****************

warp.FiducialFitWarp
---------------------

Description: Aligns image stacks by fitting fiducial spots.

Parameters:

* write\_fiducial\_images -- Flag indicating whether the aligned fiducial images should be saved. These images are helpful for visually verifying the quality of the image alignment.

warp.FiducialCorrelationWarp
-----------------------------

Description: Aligns image stacks by maximizing the cross correlation between fiducial images. 

Parameters:

* write\_fiducial\_images -- Flag indicating whether the aligned fiducial images should be saved. These images are helpful for visually verifying the quality of the image alignment.

preprocess.DeconvolutionPreprocess
-----------------------------------

Description: High-pass filters and deconvolves the image data in peparation for bit calling.

Parameters:

* warp\_task -- The name of the warp task that provides the aligned image stacks.
* highpass\_pass -- The standard deviation to use for the high pass filter.
* decon\_sigma -- The standard deviation to use for the lucy richardson deconvolution.

optimize.Optimize
------------------

Description: Determines the optimal per-bit scale factors for barcode decoding.

Parameters:

* iteration\_count -- The number of iterations to perform for the optimization.
* fov\_per\_iteration -- The number of fields of view to decode in each round of optimization.

decode.Decode
---------------

Description: Extract barcodes from all field of views.

Parameters:

* crop\_width -- The number of pixels from each edge of the image to exclude from decoding. 

filterbarcodes.FilterBarcodes
------------------------------

Description: Filters the decoded barcodes based on area and intensity

Parameters:

* area\_threshold -- Barcodes with areas below the specified area\_threshold are
removed.
* intensity\_threshold -- Barcodes with intensities below this threshold are removed.  

segment.SegmentCells
----------------------

Description: Determines cell boundaries using a nuclear stain and a cell stain.

Parameters:

* nucleus\_threshold -- The relative intensity threshold for seeding the nuclei.
* cell\_threshold -- The relative intensity threshold for setting boundaries for the watershed.
* nucleus\_index -- The image index for the nucleus image.
* cell\_index -- The image index for the cell image.
* z\_index -- The z index of the nucleus and cell images to use for segmentation.

segment.CleanCellSegmentation
--------------------------------

Description: Cleans the cell segmentation by merging cells that were fargmented along the field of view boundaries.

generatemosaic.GenerateMosaic
-------------------------------

Description: Assembles the images from each field of view into a low resolution mosaic.

Parameters:

* microns\_per\_pixel -- The number of microns to correspond with a pixel in the mosaic.
