Specifying paths with a .env file
==================================

A .env file is required to specify the search locations for the various input and output files. The following variables should be defined in a file named .env in the project root directory:

* DATA\_HOME - The path of the root directory to the raw data.
* ANALYSIS\_HOME - The path of the root directory where analysis results should be stored.
* PARAMETERS\_HOME - The path to the directory where the merfish-parameters directory resides.

The contents of an example .env file are below:

```python
DATA_HOME=D:/data
ANALYSIS_HOME=D:/analysis
PARAMETERS_HOME=D:/merfish-parameters/analysis_parameters
```

Installing prerequisites
==========================

MERlin requires python 3.6 and above. [Storm-analysis](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/storm-analysis) must be intalled prior to installing this package. Additionally, the package rtree is not properly installed by pip and should be installed independently. For example, using Anaconda:

```
conda install rtree
```

Installing MERlin
==================

MERlin can be install with pip:

```
pip install --process-dependency-links -e MERlin
```
