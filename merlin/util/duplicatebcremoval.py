    """ Depending on the separation between z planes, spots from a single
        molecule may be observed in more than one z plane. These putative
        duplicates are removed based on supplied distance and z plane
        constraints. In evaluating this method, when z planes are separated
        by 1.5 Âµm the likelihood of finding a putative duplicate above or below
        the selected plane is ~5-10%, whereas the false-positive rate is closer
        to 1%, as determined by checking two planes above or below, or comparing
        barcodes of different identities but similar abundance between
        adjacent z planes.

    Args:
        barcodes: a pandas dataframe containing all the entries for a given
                  barcode identity
        zPlanes: number of planes above and below to consider when evaluating
                 potential duplicates
        maxDist: maximum euclidean distance allowed to separate centroids of
                 putative barcode duplicate, in pixels
    Returns:
        keptBarcodes: pandas dataframe where barcodes of the same identity that
                      fall within parameters of z plane duplicates have
                      been removed.
